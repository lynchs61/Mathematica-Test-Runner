                    front-end.
    'json'        - The results are given as a single JSON object that
                    corresponds to each TestReportObject.
    'tap'         - The TAP reporter emits lines for a Test-Anything-Protocol
                    consumer.
    'junit'       - Results are given in the JUnit format
